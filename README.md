# spl-airdrop
Python script to automate sending spl vip list tokens to community members.


This script assumes you have [**python3**](https://https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed as well as both the [**solana cli**](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) & [**spl-token**](https://spl.solana.com/token).


Add the token address of your vip list token (don't forget to make it 0 decimals) in ./airdrop.py
