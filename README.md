# spl-airdrop
Python script to automate sending spl vip list tokens to community members.


This script assumes you have [**python3**](https://https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed as well as both the [**solana cli**](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) & [**spl-token**](https://spl.solana.com/token).


Replace TOKEN_ADDRESS with your spl token address in **airdrop.py**.

Replace TOKEN_AMOUNT with how many tokens to be sent to each address in **airdrop.py**.

Replace ADDRESS with the addresses to be sent tokens in **airdrop.txt**.
