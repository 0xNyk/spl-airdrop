# spl-airdrop
Python script to automate sending spl vip list tokens to community members.

This script assumes you have [**python3**](https://https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed as well as both [**solana cli**](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) & [**spl-token**](https://spl.solana.com/token).



Add your spl token address and number of tokens to be sent in airdrop.py.
Add wallet addresses in airdrop.txt.
